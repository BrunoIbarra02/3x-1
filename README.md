Overview
The 3x + 1 algorithm, also known as Collatz conjecture or the hailstone sequence, is a simple mathematical problem that has intrigued mathematicians for decades. The algorithm works as follows:

Start with any positive integer n
If n is even, divide it by 2 
If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 

Repeat the process with the resulting number, until you reach the value 1.
Despite its simplicity, the 3x + 1 algorithm poses interesting questions about number theory and has yet to be proven for all starting values.

Usage
To use this code, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the directory containing the code.
Run the code with a positive integer input.
The program will output the sequence of numbers generated by applying the 3x + 1 algorithm to the input number.
